 📌
 You can copy all the commands together 
 and paste them into termux but execute 
 them by one, not all together.

 I tell you that as a tip, do it as you
 you can and it will be easier for you.

 📌

 apt update -y

 apt install git

 git clone
 https://github.com/rajkumardusad/onex.git

 chmod +x onex/install

 ./onex/install

 onex start
